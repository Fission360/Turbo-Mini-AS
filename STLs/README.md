# Note: this mod is intended for use with a hinged tophat.
I would highly recommend the one made by MSiemons: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/MSiemons/TophatHingeV0.1

ABS/ASA is recommended for all of these parts

For Turbo.stl, do your normal Voron recommended settings, but for everything else, change the inner and outer perimeters to 0.6mm
