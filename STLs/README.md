# Note: while the fan shroud itself can be used on any V0.1 with the stock x-carriage, the fan mounting system used in this mod is intended for use with a hinged tophat.
The reason being that in my design, I found it easiest to have the 7040 blower fan mounted to the tophat. This prevented the need for any to be moved electronics and also to cut any new panels (in an attempt to make this mod as accessible as possible). But that also means you can't readily remove the tophat, and instead need it to stay connected. If you do not plan on adding a hinged tophat, then you will need to  I would highly recommend the one made by MSiemons: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/MSiemons/TophatHingeV0.1

All of these parts will print comfortably within your V0.1's build volume. ABS/ASA is recommended for all of these parts, and I would honestly recommend using a brim at least for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, since any warping can cause some fitment issues down the road.

Go ahead and use your normal Voron recommended settings for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, but for everything else, I would change the inner and outer perimeters to 0.6mm
