# Note: this mod is intended for use with a hinged tophat.
The reason being that the 7040 blower fan is mounted to the tophat, so having a removable tophat would present some challenges. I would highly recommend the one made by MSiemons: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/MSiemons/TophatHingeV0.1

ABS/ASA is recommended for all of these parts. I would honestly recommend using a brim at least for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, since any warping can cause some fitment issues down the road.

Go ahead and use your normal Voron recommended settings for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, but for everything else, I would change the inner and outer perimeters to 0.6mm
