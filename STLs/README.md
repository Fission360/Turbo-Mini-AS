# Note: while the fan shroud itself can be used on any V0.1 with the stock x-carriage, the fan mounting system used in this mod is intended for use with a hinged tophat.
The reason being that in my design, I found it easiest to have the 7040 blower fan mounted to the tophat. That way, you don't need to move any electronics, and you also don't need to cut any new panels. But that also means you can't readily remove the tophat, and instead need it to stay connected. I would highly recommend the one made by MSiemons: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/MSiemons/TophatHingeV0.1

ABS/ASA is recommended for all of these parts. I would honestly recommend using a brim at least for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, since any warping can cause some fitment issues down the road.

Go ahead and use your normal Voron recommended settings for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, but for everything else, I would change the inner and outer perimeters to 0.6mm
