# Note: while the fan shroud itself can be fitted onto any printer with the V0.1 x-carriage, the fan mount used in this mod is intended for use with a hinged tophat.
I decided that having the 7040 blower fan mounted to the tophat was the best option for a couple reasons. This prevented any electronics from needing to be moved and also didn't require you to cut any new panels (in an attempt to make this mod as accessible as possible). But this also means you can't fully remove the tophat, since it will stay connected due to the fans wires. Adding a hinged tophat made this problem trivial. If you do not plan on adding a hinged tophat, then you will need to create your own mounting solution. That being said, I would highly recommend the tophat made by MSiemons: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/MSiemons/TophatHingeV0.1

# Print Settings
All of these parts will print comfortably within your V0.1's build volume. ABS/ASA is preferred for all of the parts, and I would honestly recommend using a brim at least for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, since any warping can cause some fitment issues down the road.

Go ahead and use your normal Voron recommended settings for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, but for everything else, I would change the inner and outer perimeters to 0.6mm

# Changelog
**5/6/22: New design is 1mm taller so that the outlet sits lower underneath the heatblock. The outlets now point towards the nozzle at an angle, rather than being exactly opposite to each other (similar to the Stealthburner), in hopes of improving the cooling efficiency.**
