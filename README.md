I love my V0.1 very much. But with my current setup, the stock part cooling became the limiting factor in my quest for high-speed quality. This project was originally inspired by Vez3D and his cooling setup, and my design was built off of KurioHonoo's wonderful Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md).

If you're reading this, you are likely also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.


# What is this thing?
The V0.1 is known to have a part-cooling bottleneck as parts are printed faster, and it's not as simple as replacing the 3010 blower fans with 4010 ones. Ironically, the printer is too compact. This a mod that hopes to improve your V0.1's part cooling performance, without compromising on the compact nature of the printer.

# Why would I want this over the stock fans?
 The 7040 brushelss blower fan provides a good amount of airflow to cool down parts, and is actually quieter than the stock 3010 blowers when ouputting the same volume of air. Also, for cooling-needy plastics like PLA and even PETG, the fan opens the door for higher printing speeds using these plastics.

# What hotends/extruders does this support?
Since this was based off the Mini AfterSherpa, this was built with the Sherpa Mini in mind. There is a taller tube adapter for the Sherpa Micro if that's what you want, but you'll also need KurioHonoo's Sherpa Micro Adapter (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/STL/Mini_AfterSherpa/MiniAS_Sherpa_Micro_Adapter.stl). I haven't tested that setup myself, so I can't guarantee that everything will fit as well as with the Sherpa Mini. 
 
Currently only Dragon/Dragonfly and Revo Voron hotends are supported. I don't have any plans to do an Orbiter V1.5/V2 version, and my design is extremely hard to modify to work with the Revo Micro.

# Why is it a Beta?
I've been the only one to test my design so far. I think it's performing pretty well, but definitely not as well as I want it to. I'm calling it a beta because I want to get more testing on it first. But be on the watch for newly updated files! 

# Can I get the CAD?
Until I get more hours on my own shroud, I have decided that I will not be releasing the CAD publicly just yet. A little annoying, I know, but I'm changing the design enough to where it'd be tedious to update this repo after every new CAD revsion. But rest assured, I will be releasing f3d/step files for the design eventually, when I feel at least satisfied with the performance and *mostly* done with testing.

If you have any other questions, I'm @where'sthelambSAUCE in the Voron discord server.
