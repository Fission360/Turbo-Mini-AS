I love my V0.1 very much. But with my current setup, the stock part cooling has become the limiting factor in my quest for high-speed quality, and was preventing me from printing other plastics like PLA/PETG well. This project was originally inspired by Vez3D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kBau82SwU) and his cooling setup, and my design was built off of KurioHonoo's wonderful Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md), in which the area for the 3010 fans has been replaced with an internal ducting system, which directs air from a 7040 brushless blower fan. 

If you're reading this, you are likely also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.


# What is this thing?
It's a mod that hopes to improve your V0.1's part cooling performance.


# Why would I want this over the stock fans?
The V0.1 is known to have a part-cooling bottleneck as parts are printed faster, and it's not as simple as replacing the 3010 blower fans with 4010 ones. Ironically, the printer is too compact. So I offloaded the cooling element, which allowed me to use a more powerful blower fan that allows for more cooling. 

Additionally, if both the stock fans and the 7040 blower fan were to output, let's say 1.5 cfm, the 7040 fan would be substantially quieter than the stock fans, even though it's outputting an equivalent amount of air volume. Pretty nice, in my personal opinion.

# Why is it a Beta?
I've been the only one to test my design so far, since I didn't want a sub-performing design to be my initial release. While I think it's performing well, I do want to get feedback on my design. Like should the air be more or less focused, or should the outlets create a sheet of air rather than more of a pipe? I hope that others' feedback will help to even further improve the performance of it.
