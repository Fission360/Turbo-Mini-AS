I love my V0.1 very much. But with my current setup, the stock part cooling became the limiting factor in my quest for high-speed quality. This project was originally inspired by Vez3D and his cooling setup, and my design was built off of KurioHonoo's wonderful Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md).

If you're reading this, you are likely also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.


# What is this thing?
The V0.1 is known to have a part-cooling bottleneck as parts are printed faster. This a mod that hopes to vastly improve your V0.1's part cooling performance, without compromising on the compact nature of the printer.

# Why would I want this over the stock fans?
 The 7040 brushelss blower fan provides a good amount of airflow to cool down parts, and is actually quieter than the stock 3010 blowers when ouputting the same volume of air. Also, for cooling-needy plastics like PLA and even PETG, the fan opens the door for higher printing speeds using these plastics.

# What hotends/extruders does this support?
Since this was based off the Mini AfterSherpa, this was built with the Sherpa Mini in mind. There is a taller tube adapter for the Sherpa Micro if that's what you want, but you'll also need KurioHonoo's Sherpa Micro Adapter (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/STL/Mini_AfterSherpa/MiniAS_Sherpa_Micro_Adapter.stl). I haven't tested that setup myself, so I can't guarantee that everything will fit as well as with the Sherpa Mini. 
 
Currently only Dragon/Dragonfly and Revo Voron hotends are supported. I don't have any plans to do an Orbiter V1.5/V2 version, and my design is extremely hard to modify to work with the Revo Micro.

# Can I get the CAD?
Until I get more hours on my own shroud, I have decided that I will not be posting the CAD just yet. It's annoying, I know, but I'm changing the design daily, and I don't have time in my schedule to update this repo after every new CAD revsion. If you want the current CAD, please feel free to reach out to me about it. But rest assured, I will be posting f3d/step files here eventually, but that will be when I feel satisfied with the performance and am *mostly* done with testing.

Because at the end of the day, I've been the only one to test my design so far. I think it's performing pretty well, but I definitely feel there's room for improvement. I want to get more testing on my own rig, but be on the watch for newly updated files! 

If you have any other questions, I'm @where'sthelambSAUCE in the Voron discord server.
