# Turbo-Mini-AS (Beta v1.0.0)
![IMG_4189](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93737816/165895620-29b7efa9-3de0-40d0-9382-efdba18dc3aa.JPG)

  I love my V0.1 very much. But with my current setup, the stock part cooling became the limiting factor in my quest for high-speed quality, and was preventing me from printing other plastics like PLA/PETG a little faster. This project was originally inspired by Vez3D and his cooling setup, and my design was built off of KurioHonoo's wonderful Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md).

  If you're reading this, you are likely also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.


# What is this thing?
  It's a mod that hopes to improve your V0.1's part cooling performance by replacint the area for the 3010 blower fans with an internal ducting system, which directs air from a 7040 brushless blower fan. 

# Why would I want this over the stock fans?
  The V0.1 is known to have a part-cooling bottleneck as parts are printed faster, and it's not as simple as replacing the 3010 blower fans with 4010 ones. Ironically, the printer is too compact. So I offloaded the cooling element, which allowed me to use a more powerful blower fan that allows for more cooling. 

# What hotends/extruders does this support?
  Since this was based off the Mini AfterSherpa, this was built with the Sherpa Mini in mind. There is a taller tube adapter for the Sherpa Micro if that's what you want, but you'll also need KurioHonoo's Sherpa Micro Adapter (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/STL/Mini_AfterSherpa/MiniAS_Sherpa_Micro_Adapter.stl). I haven't tested that setup myself, so I can't guarantee that everything will fit as well as with the Sherpa Mini. 
 
Currently, only Dragon/Dragonfly hotends are supported, but once KurioHonoo finalizes his Revo Voron mount, I'll work on one for that. I don't plan on doing an Orbiter V1.5/V2 version, and my design is extremely hard to modify to work with the Revo Micro.

# Why is it a Beta?
  I've been the only one to test my design so far, since I didn't want a sub-performing design to be my initial release. While I think it's performing well, I do want to get feedback on my design. Like should the air be more or less focused, or should the outlets create a sheet of air rather than more of a pipe? I hope that others' feedback will help to even further improve the performance of it.

# Can I get the CAD?
  Until I get more hours on my own shroud, and see how others are feeling about it, I will not be releasing the CAD publicly. A little annoying, I know, but I'm taking notes from the Stealthburner development and I still think this is best until more testing is implemented. But rest assured, I will be releasing f3d/step files for the design eventually.

  If you have any other questions, I'm @where'sthelambSAUCE in the Voron discord server.
