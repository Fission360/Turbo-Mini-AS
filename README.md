I love my V0.1 to bits. With my current setup, my part cooling is the limiting factor, and which was preventing me from printing PLA/PETG/ABS just a *little* faster. If you're reading this, you may also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.

I was originally inspired by Vez3D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kBau82SwU) and his cooling setup. You will need to watch that video for some wiring, pinout, and config information I do not cover here. My design was built off of KurioHonoo's wonderful Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md), in which i have replaced the area for the 3010 fans with an internal ducting system, which directs air from a 7040 brushless blower fan.
