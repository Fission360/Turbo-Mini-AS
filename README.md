I love my V0.1 to bits. With my current setup, my part cooling is the limiting factor, and which was preventing me from printing PLA/PETG/ABS just a *little* faster. If you're reading this, you may also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.

This design was originally inspired by Vez3D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kBau82SwU), and I would say that you need to watch for some wiring and pinout stuff. I started with KurioHonoo's Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md) and replaced the area for the 3010 fans with an internal ducting system, which directs air from a 7040 brushless blower fan.
