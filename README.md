I love my V0.1 very much. With my current setup, the stock part cooling is the limiting factor, and was preventing me from printing PLA/PETG/ABS just a *little* faster. If you're reading this, you may also be dissatisfied with the V0.1's part cooling performance. Enter Turbo Mini AfterSherpa.

# What is this thing?
It's a mod to give your V0.1 significantly better part cooling

# Why would I want this over the stock fans?
The V0.1 is known to have a part-cooling bottleneck as parts are printed faster, and it's not as simple as replacing the 3010 blower fans with 4010 ones. Ironically, the printer is too compact. So I offloaded the cooling element, which allowed me to use a bigger fan that allows for *substantially* more cooling power. As in, 30-40% power is plenty for PLA at faster speeds. 

# How did I make this?
I was originally inspired by Vez3D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kBau82SwU) and his cooling setup, and my design was built off of KurioHonoo's wonderful Mini AfterSherpa (https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa/blob/main/README.md), in which i have replaced the area for the 3010 fans with an internal ducting system, which directs air from a 7040 brushless blower fan.
